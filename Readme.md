# Special Variants - A Mechwarrior 5 Mercs mod for YAML

This mod adds a selection of new variants sporting equipment from both the "Equipment Collection formerly known as Harjel" and
"Heat Sink Kits".

Most of the mechs are lore-accurate, some, however, are shamelessly ripped off of Roguetech, the greatest game ever!

## Included Normalish Variants

- Annihilatior ANH-2AX
- Cataphract CTF-5L
- Marauder MAD-S7 (RT)
- Marauder II MAD-8K
- Panther PNT-14R
- Rifleman RFL-3CR
- Thunderbolt TDR-12R
- Warhammer WHM-10K
- Warhammer WHM-66 (RT)
- Zeus ZEU-X

## Real Special Variants

- Conquistador BLK-O (an RT omni variant of the Black Knight with fixed harjel structure and engine. Not a real omni here since I do not have the hardpoint models yet.)
- Conquistador BLK-OA
- Conquistador BLK-OB
- Conquistador BLK-OC
- Warhammer IIC (just a rescale of the normal Warhammer but I just love the Warhammer so I had to add this.)
- Warhammer IIC 5
- Warhammer IIC 9
- Warhammer IIC Maul Hero Mech
- Warhammer IIC RAC Hero Mech (my own creation sporting 4 RAC/2s to shred everything)
- The april fool's joke that has gone too far: the Urbanlord UBL-RX (RT) in all its pink glory

## Additional Stuff

- Thunderbolt 5, 10, 15, 20 launchers (thank you Silby)
- Double bins for all vanilla, YAW and YAWC ammo types (2 slots, 2 tons, 2.5 times the ammo)
