# Special Variants - A Mechwarrior 5 Mercs mod for YAML

This mod adds a selection of new variants sporting equipment from both the "Equipment Collection formerly known as Harjel" and
"Heat Sink Kits".

Most of the mechs are lore-accurate, some, however, are shamelessly ripped off of Roguetech, the greatest game ever!
